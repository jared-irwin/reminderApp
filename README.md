# reminderApp

This is an app in development which will periodically send reminder notifications to the user's phone. 
This will be used to help users track their spending in order to help them achieve their financial goals.
Upon receiving a notification, the user will enter how much money they have spent that day. 
This is a first-step MVP. It could fill out to have greater functionality.
